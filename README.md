### Overview

This is the IE506 Course Programming Challenge, only available for participants of the course. This challenge has a 10% weightage in the course evaluation. So, make sure to attempt to beat the leaderboard. The top 5 submissions in this competition will get a special mention, and their winning solution will be available to all course participants.

### Goal

Each data point is associated with multiple main class labels and multiple sub class labels. The goal is to find all the main class labels and sub class labels of a data point.
Main class and sub class labels: The main class labels take values from the set {100, 200, 300,…}.
The sub class labels corresponding to main class 100 take values from the set {101,102,…,199}. (Note that it is not necessary that all 99 sub class labels are present for main class 100 in the data set).
Similarly sub class labels for main class 200 take values from the set {201, 202, 203, …, 299} and so on.
Important: Sub class labels cannot be incompatible with main class labels. That is, a data point cannot have a main class as 100 and a sub class label as 213.
